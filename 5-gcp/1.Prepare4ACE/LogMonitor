- monitoring is defined as: "Collecting, processing, aggregating, and
  displaying real-time quantitative data about a system, such as query counts
  and types, error counts and types, processing times, and server lifetimes."

2. Four Golden Signal
- Latency: how long it takes a particular part of a system to return a result.
- Traffic: how many requests are reaching the system
- Saturation: how close to capacity a system is.
- Errors: a flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program or system causes.

3. SLI, SLO, SLA
- Service Level Indicators: are carefully selected monitoring metrics that
  measure one aspect of a service's reliability.
- Service Level Objectives: combines a service level indicator with a target
  reliability.
- Service Level Aggrements: commitments made to your customers that your
  systems and applications will have only a certain amount of down time.

3. Cloud Monitoring
4. Cloud Logging:
- Analysis:
  - integrated logs Explorer.
  - can be exported to several destinations.
  - Pub/Sub messages can be analyzed in near-real time using custom code or
    stream processing.
  - BigQuery allows analysts to examine logging data through SQL queries.
  - archived log files in Cloud Storage can be analyzed with several tools and
    techniques.
- Export: eported as:
  - files to Cloud Storage
  - messages through Pub/Sub
  - into BigQuery tables.
  - Log-based metrics can be created and integrated.
- Log retention:
  - Default log retention in Cloud Logging depends on the log type.
  - Data access logs are retained by default for 30 days.
  - Admin logs are stored by default for 400 days.
  - Logs can be exported to Cloud Storage or BigQuery to extend retention.
- 4 key log categories:
  - Cloud Audit Logs: who did what, where?
  - Agent Logs: ingest log data from Google Cloud Instances
  - Network Logs
  - Service Logs: provide access to logs created by developers deploying code
    to Google Cloud.

5. Error reporting:
- counts, analyzes, and aggregates the crashes in your running cloud services.
- management interface displays the results with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- A dedicated view shows the error details.
- also create alerts to receive notifications on new errors.

6. Cloud debugger:
- debug your applications while running in production to examine your code's
  function and performance under actual production conditions.
- easy to collaborate with other team members by sharing your debug session
  simply by sending the Console URL.
- state of your application in production can be captured at a specific line
  location with snapshots.
- easily integrated into existing developer workflows.
- integrates with version control systems. 

7. Cloud Trace:
- collects "latency" data from your distributed applications and displays it in
  the Google Cloud Console.
- capture traces from applications deployed on App Engine, Compute Engine VMs,
  and Kubernetes Engine containers.
- Performance insights are provided in near-real time.
- automatically analyzes all of your application's traces to generate in-depth
  latency reports to surface performance degradations.
- gathers and analyzes trace data to automatically identify recent changes to
  your application's performance.

8. Cloud Profiler:
- using statistical techniques and extremely low-impact instrumentation that
   runs across all production application instances to provide a complete CPU
   and heap picture of an application without slowing it down.
- allows developers to analyze applications running anywhere
- presents the call hierarchy and resource consumption of the relevant function
  in an interactive flame graph
