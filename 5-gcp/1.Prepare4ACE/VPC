1. Virtual private cloud:
- A secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public
  cloud.
- VPC networks connect Google CLoud resources to each other and to the
  internet.
    - Segmenting networks
    - Using firewall rules to restrict access to instances
    - Creating static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.
- Google VPC networks are global & can have subnets in any Google Cloud region
  worldwide.

2. Objects:
- Projects:
  - Associates objects and services with billing.
  - Contain networks (up to 5) that can be shared/peer.
- Networks:
  - Has no IP address range
  - Is global & spans all available regions.
  - Contains subnetworks.
  - default, auto mode, custom mode
- Subnetworks
- Regions
- Zones
- IP address
- VM
- Routes
- Firewall rules.

8. Design:
- Increased availability with multiple zones.
- Globalization with multiple regions.
- Security: Cloud NAT provides internet access with private instances.
- Cost: Private Google Access to Google APIs and services (allow instance with
  private address only to access Google APIs and services).
