1. Routes: 
- every network has:
  - routes that let instances in a network send traffic directly to each other,
    even across subnets.
  - a default route that directs packets to destinations that are outside the
    network.
  - Firewall rules must also allow the packet.
- Routes map traffic to destination networks:
  - Apply to traffic egressing a VM.
  - Forward traffic to most specific route.
  - Are created when a subnet is created.
  - Enable VMs on same network to communicate.
  - Destination is in CIDR notation.
  - Traffic is delivered only if it also matches a firewall rule.

2. Firewall rules:
- VPC network functions as a distributed firewall.
- Firewall rules are applied to the network as a whole.
- Connections are allowed or denied at the instace level.
- Firewall rules are stateful.
- Implied deny all ingress and allow all egress.
- Parameter:
  - direction: ingress/egress
  - source / dest
  - protocol & port
  - action
  - priority
  - rule assignment: all rules are assigned to all instances or certain
    instances as well.
