1. Compute Engine:
- Can create & run virtual machine on Google infra
- No upfront investment.
- Thousands of virtual CPUs can run a system that's designed to be fast and to
  offer consistent performance.
- Each VM contains the power and functionality of a full-fledged OS.
- Can be configured much like a physical server.
- Can be created via the Google Cloud Console or via the glcoud CLI tool.
- OS: Linux & windows Server images
  - provides by Google / Cloud Market place.
  - any customized version.
- Can build and run images of other OS and flexibity reconfigure VMs.
- Scalability:
  - Horizontal: add/remove machine via autoscaling.
  - Vertical: change instance type.
- Networking:
  - built-in route table.
  - No router provisioning or managing.
  - forward traffic among instances.
  - No external IP required.
  - Firewall: Firewall rules can be defined through metadata tags on Compute
    Engine instances.
  - Interconnect:
    - Between VPC: VPC peering
    - to use the full power of Identity Access Management (IAM) to control who
      and what in one project can interact with a VPC in another, you can
      configure a Shared VPC.

4. Managed Instance groups (MIGs):
- A managed instance group (MIG) is a group of virtual machine (VM) instances
  that you treat as a single entity. 
- Each VM in a MIG is based on an instance template.
- Instance group can be resized
- Manager ensures all instance are RUNNING
  - If a VM fails or stops, the MIG recreates it based on the instance
    template. 
  - Make  MIG health checks application-based, which looks for an expected
    response from your application. The MIG will automatically recreate VMs
    that are not responding correctly. 
  - Can use w/ a load balancer.
- Typically used with autoscaller to improve scalability
- Can be single zone or regional
- Automated updates: Applying new configurations to VMs in a MIGs
  - First, Updated instance templates & per-instance configuration
  - Second, apply updates:
    - Automated rolling update (Proactive mode): roll out a new version of an
      instance template to all or to a random subset of managed instances in the MIG.
    - Selective update of specific instances (Opportunistic mode): target
      selected instances for an update.
- Creation:
  - create an instance template.
  - After you create an instance template you need to conﬁgure your managed
    instance group. Here is where you specify location settings, describe port
    mappings, and reference the instance template.
  - You also specify the number of instances in your group, conﬁgure
    autoscaling, and create health checks for your instances to determine which
    instances should receive traﬃc.
- Support:
  - Zonal 
  - Regional
- Autoscaling:
  - Dynamically add/remove instances
  - Autoscaling policy:
    - CPU utilization
    - Load balacing capcity
    - Monitoring metrics
    - Queue-based workload
