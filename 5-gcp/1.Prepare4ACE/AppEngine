- App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting
  web applications at scale.
- choose popular coding languages, libraries, frameworks to develop apps with familar tools.
- provides built-in services & APIs that common to most apps.
- offer Sofware Development Kits (SDKs) includes:
  - All of the APIs and libraries available to App Engine
  - A simulated, secure sandbox environment that emulates all of the App Engine services on your local computer, 
  - Deployment tools to upload your application to the cloud and manage different versions.
-  the Security Command Center automatically scan & detect common web app
   vulnerabilities.

2. Environment:
- Standard:
  - Persistent storage with queries, sorting, and transaction
  - Automatic scaling and load balancing
  - Asynchronous task queues for performing work outside the scope of a request
  - Scheduled tasks for triggering events at specified times or regular intervals
  - Integration with other Google Cloud services and APIs
  - Requirements:
    - Must use specified versions of Java, Python, PHP, Go, Node.js, and Ruby.
    - Apps must conform to sandbox constraints that are dependent on runtime.
  - Follow 3 steps:
    - A web application is developed and tested locally.
    - The SDK is used to deploy the application to App Engine.
    - App Engine scales and services the application
- Flexible:
  - Run in a docker container on Google Compute Engine, which managed by App
    Engine.
  - Instances are health-checked, healed as necessary, and co-located.
  - Critical, backward-compatible updates are automatically applied to the
    underlying operating system.
  - VM instances are automatically located by geographical region according to
    the settings in your project.
  - VM instances are restarted on a weekly basis.
  - Supports microservices, authorization, SQL and NoSQL databases, traffic
    splitting, logging, search, versioning, security scanning, Memcache, and
    content delivery networks.
  - Allow:
    - Custom configurations and libs.
    - Customize the runtime & the operating system of your VM.
