1. VPC networks types:
- Default:
  - every project
  - One subnet per region
  - Default firewall rules
- Auto Mode:
  - Default network.
  - One subnet per region
  - Regional IP allocation.
  - Fixed /20 subnetwork per region.
  - Expandable up to /16
- Custom Mode:
  - No default subnets created.
  - Full control of IP ranges
  - Regional IP allocation.
  - Expandable to IP ranges you specify

2. Rules:
- To expand subnets without re-creating instances:
  - Cannot overlap with other subnets.
  - IP range must be a unique valid CIDR block
  - New subnet IP ranges have to fall within valid IP ranges.
  - Can expand but not shrink.
  - Auto mode can be expanded from /20 to /16.
  - Avoid large subnets.

3. IP address:
- Internal IP:
  - Allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP.
  - DHCP lease is renewed every 24h
  - VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS.
- External IP:
  - Assigned from pool (ephemeral)
  - Reserved (static)
  - BYOIP (Bring your own IP address)
  - VM doesn't know eternal IP; it is mapped to the internal IP.

4. DNS:
- Internal addresses:
  - Each instance has a hostname that can be resolved to an internal IP
    address:
      - The hostname is the same as the instance name
      - FQDN: [hostname].[zone].c.[project-id].internal
  - Name resolution is handled by internal DNS resolver:
    - Provided as part of Compute Engine (169.254.169.254)
    - Configured for use on instance via DHCP
    - Provides answer for internal and external address.
- External address:
  - Instances with external IP addresses can allow connections from hosts
    outside the project.
      - Users connect directly using external IP address.
      - Admins can also publish DNS records pointing to the instance.
        - Public DNS records are not published automatically.
  - DNS records for external address can be pulished using existing DNS servers
    (outside of Google Cloud).
  - DNS zones can be hosted using Cloud DNS.

5. Cloud DNS:
- Google DNS service
- Low latency
- 100% uptime SLA
- Create and update militions of DNS records.
- via UI, CLI or API

6. Assign a range of IP addresses as aliases to a VM's network interface using
alias IP ranges.

7. Cloud NAT:
