1. Cloud Run:
- Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run stateless
  containers via web requests or Pub/Sub events.
- Serverless Container management.
- Its built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes
- Based on a service resource.
- A service exposes an endpoint:
  - Regional
  - Replicated across zones.
- Autoscalling:
  - Scales based on incoming requests.
  - Automatically scales to 0, when no traffic is received.
  - to affect:
    - CPU ultization.
    - Concurrency settings: limit concurrent requests.
    - Max number of instances: help control costs & limit connection.
    - Min number of instances
- Instances that are started might remain idle for up to 15 minutes to reduce
  latency associated with cold starts.
- be charged only for the resources used, when handling requests (include
  startup & shutdown).

2. Step:
- Container-based Workflow:
  - Write code
  - Build & package apps into a container image.
  - Image will be pused to Artifact Registry, where Cloud Run will deploy it.
- Source-based workflow:
  - Write code
  - The rest will be completed by Cloud Run.
. Once youve deployed your container image, youll get a unique HTTPS URL back.
  - by default, ***.run.app
  - or custom domain.
- Finally, Cloud Run then starts your container on demand to handle requests, and
  ensures that all incoming requests are handled by dynamically adding and
  removing containers.
