1. Pricing
- Per second billing, with minimum of 1 min.
  - vCPUs, GPUs and GB of memory.
- Resource-based pricing:
  - Each vCPU & each GB of memory are billed separately.
- Discounts:
  - sustained-use discounts startto apply automatically to VM the longer they
    run. for each VM that runs for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine
    automatically applies a discount for every additional minute.
  - Commited-use discount: This means that for stable and predictable
    workloads, a specific amount of vCPUs and memory can be purchased for up to
    a 57% discount off of normal prices in return for committing to a usage
    term of one year or three years.
  - Preemptible & Spot VMs.
- Recommendation Engine:
  - Notifies of underutilized machines.
- Free usage limits

2. Preemptible:
- Lower price for interruptible service
- VM might be terminatedat any time.
  - No charge if terminated in the first min
  - 24h max
  - 30-second terminate warning, but not guaranteed.
    - Time for a shutdown script.
- No live migrate; no auto restart.
- Can request that CPU quota for a region be split between regular & preemption
  - Default: preemptible VMs count against region CPU quota.

3. Sport VMs:
- latest version of preemptible VMs.
- Share the same pricing model.
- No min or max runtime.
- Finite Compute Engine resources, so they might not always be available.
- No live migrate; no auto restart.

4. Sole-tenant nodes physically isolate workloads.
- Secure Boot
- Virtual trusted platform module (vTPM)
- Integrity monitoring.

5. Confidential VMs allow to encrypt data in use.
- Encrypts data while it's being procesed.
- Easy to use with no changes to code or performance compromise.
