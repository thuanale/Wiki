1. Cloud Storage:
- helps you store binary objects in Google Cloud. 
- Object packaged format contains:
  - Binary form of the actual data itself.
  - Relevant associated meta-data
  - Globally unique identifier - These unique keys are in the form of URLs.
- Can house data in any format as an immutable object. 
- In Cloud Storage, objects are stored in containers called buckets.
- Buckets can be used to upload and download objects, and permissions can be
  assigned to specify who has access to them.
- A bucket needs a globally unique name and a specific geographic location for
  where it should be stored.
- Cloud Storages primary use is whenever binary large-object storage (also
  known as a BLOB) is needed for online content such as videos and photos, for
  backup and archived data and for storage of intermediate results in
  processing workflows.
- You can manage and interact with Cloud Storage via:
  - the console
  - via the command line
  - the gsutil command set
  - via client libraries
  - or through APIs.
- Security:
  - Cloud IAM
  - ACL: Scope (who) + Permission (what).
    - Maximum number of ACL entries you can create for a bucket or object is
      100.
  - signed URLs:
    - Ticket is a cryptographically signed URL
    - time-limited
    - Operations specified in ticket: HTTP GET, PUT, DELETE.
    - Any user with URL can invoke permitted operations.
  - signed policy document:
    - refines the control by determining what kind of file can be uploaded by
      someone with a signed URL.
- Benefit:
  - Itâ€™s scalable to exabytes of data.
  - The time to first byte is in milliseconds.
  - has very high availability across all storage classes
  - has a single API across those storage classes

2. Storage classes and use cases summary:
- Data location:
  - Regional
    - Lower cost per GB stored
    - Data stored in a narrow geographic region
    - Redundant across zones
    - Can never be changed to multi-region
  - Dual-regional 
  - Multi-regional
    - Redundant accross regions
    - Can't be changed to regional.
- Storage class:
  - Standard
    - default
    - immediately available
  - Nearline
    - Very low cost per GB stored
    - Higher per-operation costs
    - 30-day minimum storage duration
  - Coldline
    - Lowest cost per GB stored
    - Higher per-operation costs
    - 90-day minimum storage duration.
  - Archive storage:
    - Long-term storage for data accessed only once a year.
  - Access data before the minimum amount of time will be chared a data access
    fee.
  - inherited from parent

3. Object Lifecycle:
- Object metadata has to match all rules for the action to fire.
- If an object state matches more than one rule set, delete takes precedence,
  followed by storage class with lowest price.
- Object inspection occurs in asynchronous batches.
- Changes can take 24 hours to apply.

4. Steps for creating a cloud bucket include:
- Naming bucket:
- Location type:
  - Dual region: a specific pair or regions. It provides geo-redundancy.
- Storage class

5. Tranfer data to Cloud Storage:
- Online transfer: console
- Storage Transfer Service: The Storage Transfer Service lets you schedule and
  manage batch transfers to Cloud Storage from another cloud provider, from a
  different Cloud Storage region, or from an HTTP(S) endpoint.
- Transfer Appliance: hardware

6. Features:
- CSEK (Customer-supplied encryption key)
- Object Lifecycle Management
- Object Versioning
- Directory synchronization.
- Object change notifications using Pub/Sub.

7. Data import services:
- Transfer Appliance: 
  - Rack, capture and then ship your data to Google Cloud
  - Support up to 1 PB
- Storage Transfer Service:
  - import online data
- Offline Media Import:
  - third-party provider uploads the data from physical media.

8. Global consitency:
- Read-after-write
- Read-after-metadata-update
- Read-after-delete
- Bucket listing
- Oject listing
