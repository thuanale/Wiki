- Cloud VPN securely connects your on-premises network to your GCP VPC network
  through an IPsec VPN tunnel.
- Support:
  - Site-to-site VPN
  - Static routes
  - Dynamic routes (Cloud Router)
  - IKEv1 and IKEv2 ciphers.
- For a successful VPN, tunnel for each direction must be set up.

2. Dynamic routing w/ Cloud Router:
- Cloud Router can manage routes for a Cloud VPN tunnel using BGP.
- To automatically propagate network configuration changes, the VPN tunnel uses
  Cloud Router to establish a BGP session between the VPC and the on-premises
  VPN gateway, which must support BGP.

3. Static routing:
- Need to configure routes in routing table.
