1. Load balancing:
- Global HTTP(S):
  - Layer 7 loadbalacing based on load
  - Anycast IP address
  - Support HTTP: HTTP/port 80/port 8080
  - Support HTTPs: HTTPs or port 443
  - URL maps: Can route different URLs to different backends
- Global SSL Proxy:
  - Layer 4 load balancing of non-HTTPS SSL traffic based on load.
  - Terminates SSL session at load balancing layer.
  - Supported on specific port numbers.
- Global TCP Proxy:
  - Layer 4 load balancing of non-SSL TCP traffic
  - terminates your customers’ TCP sessions at the load balancing layer, then
    forwards the traffic to your virtual machine instances using TCP or SSL.
  - Supported on specific port numbers.
- Regional (aka Regional network):
  - Load balancing of any traffic (TCP, UDP)
  - Supported on any port number
  - Support IPv4 only
  - Architect:
    - Backend service-based
    - Target pool-based
- Regional internal:
  - Load balancing of traffic inside a VPC.
  - Use for the internal tiers of multi-tier applications.
  - Software-defined
  - Two types:
    - Internal TCP/UDP
      - directly delivers the traffic from the client instance to a backend
        instance.
    - Internal HTTP/HTTPS
- 3 types of global LB support IPv6

2. Backend services:
  - Contain:
    - Health check
    - Session affinitiy:
      - Optional
      - attempts to send all requests from the same client to the same virtual
        machine instance.
    - Time out setting:
      - 30 secs by default.
      - the amount of time the backend service will wait on the backend before
        considering the request a failure.
    - One/more backends:
      - An instance group (managed/unmanaged)
      - A balancing mode:
        - tells the load balancing system how to determine when the backend is
          at full usage.
        - based on CPU utilization or RPS
      - A capacity scaler:
        - is an additional control that interacts with the balancing mode
          setting.
        - based on ceiling percentage of CPU/Rate targets

3. HTTPS load balancing:
- Target HTTPS proxy
- One signed SSL certificate installed.
  - Support up to 15 certicates per the target proxy
  - For each SSL certificate, you first create an SSL certificate resource,
    which contains the SSL certificate information.
- Client SSL session terminates at the load balancer
- Support the QUIC transport layer protocol.

4. Backend bucket: 
- Use case:
  - Dynamic requests are redirected to backend service.
  - Static requests are sent to backend bucket.

5. Network Endpoint Groups (NEG):
- a configuration object that specifies a group of backend endpoints or
  services.
- can use NEGs as backends for some load balancers and with Traffic Director.
- Types:
  - Zonal:
    - contains one or more endpoints that can be Compute Engine VMs or services
      running on the VMs.
    - Each endpoint is specified either by an IP address or an IP:port
      combination.
  - Internet:
    - contains a single endpoint that is hosted outside of Google Cloud.
    - This endpoint is specified by hostname FQDN:port or IP:port.
  - Serverless:
    - points to Cloud Run, App Engine, Cloud Functions services residing in the
      same region as the NEG.
  - Hybrid connectivity:
    - points to Traffic Director services running outside of Google Cloud.

6. Backend service-based architecture:
- Regional backend service.
- Deﬁnes the behavior of the load balancer and how it distributes traﬃc to its
  backend instance groups.
- Enables new features not supported with legacy target pools:
  - Non-legacy health checks
  - Auto-scaling with managed instance groups
  - Connection draining
  - Conﬁgurable failover policy

7. Target pool-based architecture
- Forwarding rules (TCP and UDP)
- Up to 50 per project
- One health check
- Instances must be in the same region.

2. CloudDNS
- Programmable: can publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using
  the Cloud Console, the command-line interface, or the API.

3. CloudCDN:
