1. Cloud SQL:
- Cloud SQL offers fully managed relational databases as a service, including:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQL Server

2.  Charateristics:
- Cloud SQL: Doesn't require any software installation or maintenance.
- Can scale up to 64 processor cores, 400+ GB of RAM, and 30 TB of storage.
- Supports automatic replication scenarios
- Supports managed backups - The cost of an instance covers seven backups.
- Encrypts customer data when on Googles internal networks and when stored in
  database tables, temporary files, and backups.
- Includes a network firewall.
- Patches and updates automatically applied
- You administer MySQL users
- Support multiple clients

3. Performance: 
- <= 64TB of storage
- <= 60k IOS
- <= 624GB of RAM
- Scale out with read replicas.

4. Cloud SQL services:
- HA configuration: 
  - Primary / Standby
  - regional instances with synchronous replication
- Provides automated and on-demand backups with point-in-time recovery.
- Import/export via:
  - mysqldump
  - import & export CSV files.
- Can also scale up, which does require a machine restart or scale out using
  read replicas.

5. Connecting to SQL instance:
- within Google Cloud: via SQL private IP
- Connecting from outside Google Cloud:
  - Need manual control over SSL certificates
    - Generate & periodically rotate the certificates yourself.
    - Otherwise, use an unencrypted connection by authorizing a specific
      address to connect to your SQL server over its external IP.
  - If need auto control over SSL certificates: Cloud proxy
