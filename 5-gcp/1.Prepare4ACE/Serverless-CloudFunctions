1. Cloud Functions:
- Serverless function execution
- Event based
- Functions trigger when an event occurs.
  - A trigger sends an https request to an endpoint the service is listening
    on.
  - This endpoint then responds by deploying and executing the function and
    returning the results specified in your code. 
- Scales by number of events received.
- Functions are stateless - need to persist data if you need to share it
  outsite the function.
- Pricing:
  - based on the number of events, compute time, and memory required in network
    ingress/egress.
  - If no requests are coming in, your function doesnâ€™t cost anything.
- Use cases: 
  - Data processing/ETL: listen & respond to Cloud Storage events
  - Webhooks: via a simple HTTP trigger
  - Lightweight APIs
  - Mobile backend
  - IoT processing.
- Depending on the programming language you choose, the Cloud Functions
service provides a base image and runtime that will be updated and patched
automatically.
- You can implement minimum instance limits to avoid latency associated with
  cold starts.
