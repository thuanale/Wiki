1. Operation suite:
- Integrated monitoring, logging, diagnostics
- Manages across platforms:
  - Gcloud and AWS
  - Dynamic discovery of Google Cloud with smart defaults
  - Open-source agents and integrations
- Access to powerful data & analytics tools
- Collaboration with third-party software.

2. Cloud Monitoring:
- Dynamic config and intelligent defaults.
- Monitor platform, system, and application metrics:
  - Ingest data: metrics, events and metadata
  - Generates insights through dashboards, chards, alerts.
- also look at logs associated with resources from the dashboard. 
- monitor messages being posted to your pubsub topic for the transportation
  management app or via email.
- Custom metrics allow you to define metrics descriptors for things you want
  to keep track of that aren’t included in standard metrics.
- A metrics scope is the root entity that holds monitoring and configuration
  information in Cloud Monitoring.
  - Each metrics scope can have between 1 and 100 monitored projects. 
  - Can have as many metrics scopes as you want.
  - For Google Cloud projects and AWS accounts can't be monitored by more than
    one metrics scope.
  - Contain custom dashboards, alerting policies, uptime checks, notification
    channels, and group definitions that you use with your monitored projects.
  - The first monitored Google Cloud project in a metrics scope is called the
    hosting project, and it must be specified when you create the metrics
    scope.
    - The name of that project becomes the name of your metrics scope.
  - To access an AWS account, a project must be configured in Gcloud to hold
    AWS Connector.
  - All users of Google Cloud’s operations suite with access to that metrics
    scope have access to all data by default.
- Monitoring agent:
  - Allow to access additional system resources and app services.
  - Support for Compute Engine & EC2 instances.

3. Cloud Logging:
- allows you to log any timestamped data in logs you define and manage.
- There are a myriad of options for where you can save your logs and how to
  route them.
- There is also an interface provided to query your logs.
- Need to install logging agent to get additional log
  - Support for Compute Engine & EC2 instances.

4. Error Reporting:
- Aggregate and display errors for running cloud services
  - Error notifications
  - Error dashboard

5. Cloud Tracing:
- a distributed tracing system:
  - collects latency data from your applications
  - displays it in the Cloud Console.
  - Displays data in near real-time.
- Collect latency data:
  - App Engine
  - Google HTTPs LB
  - Apps instrumented with the Cloud Trace SDKs.

6. Debugging:
- Inspect an application without stopping it or slowing it down significantly.
- Debug snapshots:
  - Capture call stack and local variables of a running application.
- Debug logpoints:
  - Inject logging into a service without stopping it.
- Support multiple coding languages.
