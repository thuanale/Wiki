                   Resource hierarchy:
- Bottom up: Resources => Project => Folder => Organization
- Resources: Google cloud services
- Projects:
  - Separate entities under Organization node.
  - Each resources belongs to just one Project.
  - Have different owners & users.
  - Billed & managed separately.
  - 3 identified attributes:
    - Project ID:
      - Globally unique
      - Assigned by Google Cloud but mutable during creation
      - Immutable after creation
    - Project name:
      - Need not be unique
      - Human-readable
      - Choose by you
      - Mutable
    - Project number:
      - Globally unique
      - Assigned by Google cloud
      - Immutable
  - Can be managed by: Resource Manager Tool
  - Project can be under organization, folders or none of them.
- Folder:
  - Let you assign policies to resouces at a level of granularity you choose.
  - Folder can contain projects, folders or both.
  - Must belong to organization
- Organization
  - When need to centrally apply organization-wide policies.
  - With & without Google Workspace:
    - with: projects will automatically belong to customers' organization node.
    - without: use Cloud Identity to create organization node.
- Policy:
  - Defined at project, folder, organization levels
  - Some google cloud services allow to grant policy to individual resources.
  - Inherited downward.
  - When a child node inherits organization policies based on list
    constraints, the inherited policies are merged and reconciled with the
    node's organization policy. In list policy evaluation, DENY values always
    take precedence.
  - Organization policies that are derived from boolean constraints do not
    merge and reconcile policies. If a policy is specified on a resource node,
    that TRUE or FALSE value is used to determine the effective policy.

2. Quotas:
