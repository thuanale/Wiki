- Google Cloud Pub/Sub is an asynchronous global messaging service. 
- There are 3 terms in Pub/Sub that appear often: topics, publishing, and
  subscribing.
   - A topic is a shared string that allows applications to connect with one
     another through a common thread.
   - Publishers push (or publish) a message to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
   - Subscribers will then make a subscription to that thread, where they will
     either pull messages from the topic or configure webhooks for push
     subscriptions. Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable
     window of time.
   - In sum, a publisher creates and sends messages to a topic and a subscriber
     creates a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it.
