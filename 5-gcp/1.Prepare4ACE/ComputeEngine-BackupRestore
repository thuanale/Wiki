1. Backup:
2. Restore:
3. Move an instance to a new zone:
- Automated process (moving within region):
  - gcloud compute instances move.
  - manual steps: update references to VM.
- Manual process (moving between regions):
  - Snapshots all persistent disks of VM
  - Create new disks in destination zones
  - Create new VM & attach created disks.
  - Assign IP
  - Update reference
  - Delete snapshots, original disks & old VM.

4. How incremental snapshots work:
- Snapshots are incremental by default.
- To ensure the reliability of snapshot history, a full snapshot might occasionally
  & automatically capture a full image of the disk.
- When this occurs, previous incremental snapshots of that disk are unchanged.
- You can only create them for persistent disks. 
- Stored in a Cloud Storage bucket managed by the snapshot service and are
  automatically compressed.
- Can be regional or multi-regional storage. 
- Snapshots are stored across multiple locations with automatic checksums. 
- Schedule:
  - using the gcloud command line and cron. 
  - using Google cloud console or command line.
  - A Snapshot schedule and its source persistent disk have to be in the same region. 
  - Can create them while they are running.
- Incremental snapshots work as follows:
  - The first successful snapshot of a persistent disk is a full snapshot that
    contains all the data on the persistent disk.
  - The second snapshot only contains any new data or modified data since the
    first snapshot. Data that hasn't changed since snapshot 1 isn't included.
    Instead, snapshot 2 contains references to snapshot 1 for any unchanged
    data.
  - Snapshot 3 contains any new or changed data since snapshot 2 but won't
    contain any unchanged data from snapshot 1 or 2. Instead, snapshot 3
    contains references to blocks in snapshot 1 and snapshot 2 for any
    unchanged data.
  - This repeats for all subsequent snapshots of the persistent disk. Snapshots
    are always created based on the last successful snapshot taken.
- Snapshot deletion:
  - If your disk has a snapshot schedule, you must detach the snapshot schedule
    from the disk before you can delete the schedule.
  - If the snapshot has no depedent snapshots, Compute Engine immediately marks
    the snapshots as DELETED in the system.
  - Otherwise:
    - Any data that is required for restoring other snapshots is moved into the
      next snapshot, increasing its size.
    - Any data that is not required for restoring other snapshots is deleted.
    - The next snapshot references the snapshot before the deleted one.
