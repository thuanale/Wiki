1. Common File Types:
- RHEL support 7 file types:
  - regular: text, binary.
  - directory
  - device file: file is created and associated with a piece of hardware in the
    system & is used by the system to communicate with the device.
    - block special device file
    - character (raw) special device file
    - Each device driver is assigned a unique number called the major number,
      which the kernel uses to recognize its type.
    - The kernel in this situation allots a minor number to each individual
      device within that device driver category to identify it as a unique
      device.
  - symbolic link
  - named pipe
  - socket.
- command to determine:
  - file
  - stat

2. Compression and Archiving:
- tar
- gzip/gunzip
- bzip2/bunzip2

3. File editing:
- vim

4. File & directory operations:
- touch /vim
- cat / tac
- less / more
- head / tail
- wc
- cp
- rm
- rmdir

5. File linking:
- Each file within a file system has a multitude of attributes assigned to it
  at the time of its creation.
- These attributes are collectively referred to as the file's metadata, and
  they change when the file is accessed or modified.
- A file's metadata includes several pieces of information, such as the file
  type, size, permissions, owner's name, owning group name, last
  access/modification times, link count, number of allocated blocks, and
  pointers to the data storage location.
- This metadata takes 128 bytes of space for each file.
- This tiny storage space is referred to as the file's inode (index node).
- An inode is assigned a unique numeric identifier that is used by the kernel
  for accessing, tracking, and managing the file.
- In order to access the inode and the data it points to, a filename is
  assigned to recognize it and access it.
- This mapping between an inode and a filename is referred to as a link.
- It is important to note that the inode does not store the filename in its
  metadata; the filename and corresponding inode number mapping is maintained
  in the directory's metadata where the file resides.

- Soft link:
  - A soft link (a.k.a. a symbolic link or a symlink) makes it possible to
    associate one file with another.
  - Similar to shortcut in Windows.
  - Each soft link has a unique inode number that stores the pathname to the
    file it is linked with.
  - Delete orginial file, make soft link file invalid.
  - For a symlink, the link count does not increase or decrease, rather each
    symlinked file receives a new inode number.
  - The pathname can be absolute or relative depending on what was specified at
    the time of its creation.
  - The size of the soft link is the number of characters in the pathname to
    the target.
  - A soft link can cross a file system boundary and it can be used to link
    directories.


- Hard link: 
  - A hard link is a mapping between one or more filenames and an inode number,
    making all hard-linked files indistinguishable from one another.
  - This implies that all hard-linked files will have identical metadata.
    Changes to the file metadata and content can be made by accessing any of
    the filenames.
  - A hard link cannot cross a file system boundary, and it cannot be used to
    link directories because of the restrictions placed within Linux designed
    to avoid potential issues with some commands.
