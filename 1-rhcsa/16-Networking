1. Elementary:
1.1 Hostname:
- A hostname is a unique alphanumeric label (the hyphen (-), underscore (_),
  and period (.) characters are also allowed) that is assigned to a node to
  identify it on the network. 
- It can consist of up to 253 characters.
- In RHEL, the hostname is stored in the /etc/hostname file.
- To change:
  - Method 1: edit in /etc/hostname & restart systemd-hostname service.
  - Method 2: hostnamectl set-hostname <name> & logoff & login again.
1.2. Protocol:
- A protocol is a set of rules governing the exchange of data between two
  network entities.
- These rules include how data is formatted, coded, and controlled.
- The rules also provide error handling, speed matching, and data packet
  sequencing.
- view in /etc/protocols

1.3. Well-known ports:
- A well-known port is reserved for an application's exclusive use, and it is
  standardized across all network operating systems.
- Well-known ports are defined in the /etc/services file.
- A private port, on the other hand, is an arbitrary number generated when a
  client application attempts to establish a communication session with its
  server process.
- This port number no longer exists after the session has ended.
