1. What is Linux:
- Free & Unix-like OS:
  - Similar to Unix in terms of concepts, defautres, functionality & stability.
- Also call GNU/Linux, Linux OS or Linux
- Kernel to drive & control the GNU software and to regulate its communication
  with the hardware.

2. RHEL:
- RHEL installer program is called Anaconda.
- Files in the /var/log/anaconda directory are actually created and updated in
  the /tmp directory during the installation; however, they are moved over once
  the installation is complete.

3. Virtual Console Screens: 
- Console 1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1): This is the main screen. Before Anaconda begins, you
  will select a language to use during installation, and then it will switch
  the default console to the sixth screen (Console 6).
- Console 2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2): The screen displays the shell interface to run
  commands as the root user.
- Console 3 (Ctrl+Alt+F3): This screen displays installation messages and
  stores them in /tmp/anaconda.log file. This file also captures information on
  detected hardware, in addition to other data.
- Console 4 (Ctrl+Alt+F4): This screen shows storage messages and records them
  in /tmp/storage.log file.
- Console 5 (Ctrl+Alt+F5): This screen displays program messages and logs them
  to /tmp/program.log file.
- Console 6 (Ctrl+Alt+F6): This is the default graphical configuration and
  installation console screen.

4. GUI:
- Wayland: a client/server display protocol that sets up the foundation for
  running graphical programs and applications in RHEL 8.
- 2 components that are critical to the functionality of a graphical
  environment:
  - Display/Login manager:
    - default on RHEL8: GNOME Display Manger 
    - handle the presentation of graphical login screen.
    - a list of all normal user accounts that exist on the system.
    - other users can be accessed via "Not listed".
  - Desktop environment:
    - Once the credentials are validated for a user, the display/login manager
      establishes a Desktop Environment (DE) to work in.
    - by default: GNOME desktop environment.
