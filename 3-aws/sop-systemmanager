                System Manager
1. Introduction: 
- AWS Systems Manager is a collection of features that enable IT Operations. 
- There are set up tasks and pre-requisites that must be satisfied prior to using Systems Manager to manage your EC2 instances or on-premises systems in hybrid environments . 
  - You must use a supported operating system.
  - The SSM Agent must be installed 
  - Your EC2 instances must have outbound internet access 
  - You must access Systems Manager in a supported region 
  - Systems Manager requires IAM roles 
    - for instances that will process commands 
    - for users executing commands 
- There is no additional charge for AWS Systems Manager . You only pay for your underlying AWS resources managed or created by AWS Systems Manager (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon CloudWatch metrics). You only pay for what you use as you use it. There are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments. 

2. Fleet Manager 

3. Inventory 
- You can use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to collect operating system (OS), application, and instance metadata from your Amazon EC2 instances and your on-premises servers or virtual machines (VMs) in your hybrid environment. 
- You can query the metadata to quickly understand which instances are running the software and configurations required by your software policy, and which instances need to be updated. 

4. State Manager 
- In State Manager, an association is the result of binding configuration information that defines the state you want your instances to be in to the instances themselves. This information specifies when and how you want instance-related operations to run that ensure your Amazon EC2 and hybrid infrastructure is in an intended or consistent state. 
- An association defines the state you want to apply to a set of targets. An association includes three components and one optional set of components: 
  - A document that defines the state 
  - Target(s) 
  - A schedule 
  - (Optional) Runtime parameters. 
- When you performed the Setup Inventory actions, you created an association in State Manager. 

5. Compliance 
- You can use AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance to scan your fleet of managed instances for patch compliance and configuration inconsistencies. You can collect and aggregate data from multiple AWS accounts and Regions, and then drill down into specific resources that aren’t compliant. 
- By default, Configuration Compliance displays compliance data about Systems Manager Patch Manager patching and Systems Manager State Manager associations. You can also customize the service and create your own compliance types based on your IT or business requirements. You can also port data to Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to generate fleet-wide reports. 

6. Patch Manager: 
- AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances with security related updates. 
- For Linux-based instances, you can also install patches for non-security updates. 
- You can patch fleets of Amazon EC2 instances or your on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type. This includes supported versions of Windows, Ubuntu Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Amazon Linux. You can scan instances to see only a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches. You can target instances individually or in large groups by using Amazon EC2 tags. 
- Warning:
  - AWS does not test patches for Windows or Linux before making them available in Patch Manager.
  - If any updates are installed by Patch Manager the patched instance is rebooted.
  - Always test patches thoroughly before deploying to production environments. 

7. Patch Baseline:
- Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches. 
- Patch Manager integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon CloudWatch Events to provide a secure patching experience that includes event notifications and the ability to audit usage. 

8. Patch Group: 
- A patch group is an optional method to organize instances for patching. 
- Benefit:
  - avoid deploying patches to the wrong set of instances.
  - avoid deploying patches before they have been adequately tested. 
- You create a patch group by using Amazon EC2 tags.
  - Tag key: Patch Group
  - Value: any
- An instance can only be in one patch group. 
- After you create a patch group and tag instances, you can register the patch group with a patch baseline. By registering the patch group with a patch baseline, you ensure that the correct patches are installed during the patching execution. When the system applies a patch baseline to an instance, the service checks if a patch group is defined for the instance. 
  - If the instance is assigned to a patch group, the system checks to see which patch baseline is registered to that group. 
  - If a patch baseline is found for that group, the system applies that patch baseline. 
  - If an instance isn’t assigned to a patch group, the system automatically uses the currently configured default patch baseline. 

9. AWS-RunPatchBaseline:
- AWS-RunPatchBaseline is a command document that enables you to control patch approvals using patch baselines. It reports patch compliance information that you can view using the Systems Manager Compliance tools. For example,you can view which instances are missing patches and what those patches are. 
For Linux operating systems, compliance information is provided for patches from both the default source repository configured on an instance and from any alternative source repositories you specify in a custom patch baseline. AWS-RunPatchBaseline supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. 
- An AWS Systems Manager document defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances. Systems Manager includes many pre-configured documents that you can use by specifying parameters at runtime, including ‘AWS-RunPatchBaseline’. These documents use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML (a recursive acronym for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”), and they include steps and parameters that you specify. 

10. Run Command:
- All AWS provided Automation and Run Command documents can be viewed in AWS Systems Manager Documents. You can create your own documents or launch existing scripts using provided documents to implement custom operations as code activities. 
- AWS Systems Manager Run Command lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. Run Command enables you to automate common administrative tasks and perform ad hoc configuration changes at scale. You can use Run Command from the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs. 

11. Maintenance Windows: 
- AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances such as patching an operating system (OS), updating drivers, or installing software. Each Maintenance Window has a schedule, a duration, a set of registered targets, and a set of registered tasks. With Maintenance Windows, you can perform tasks like the following: 
  - Installing applications, updating patches, installing or updating SSM Agent, or executing PowerShell commands and Linux shell scripts by using a Systems Manager Run Command task 
  - Building Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), boot-strapping software, and configuring instances by using Systems Manager Automation 
  - Executing AWS Lambda functions that trigger additional actions such as scanning your instances for patch updates 
  - Running AWS Step Function state machines to perform tasks such as removing an instance from an Elastic Load Balancing environment, patching the instance, and then adding the instance back to the Elastic Load Balancing environment. 
- To register Step Function tasks you must use the AWS CLI. 
- When you register a task with a Maintenance Window, you specify the role you created, which the service will assume when it runs tasks on your behalf. To register the task, you must assign the IAM PassRole policy to your IAM user account. The policy in the following procedure provides the minimum permissions required to register tasks with a Maintenance Window.

12. SNS:
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. 
- In Amazon SNS, there are two types of clients: publishers and subscribers. These are also referred to as producers and consumers. 
- Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Subscribers (i.e., web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions) consume or receive the message or notification over one of the supported protocols (i.e., Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda) when they are subscribed to the topic.
