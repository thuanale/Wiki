1. Hypervisor:
- Virtualization is defined as enabling multiple operating systems to run on a
  single host computer.
- Hypervisor is the essential component in the virtualization stack
  - also called Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).
  - creates a virtual platform on the host computer, on top of which multiple
    guest operating systems are executed and monitored.
  - This way, multiple operating systems, which are either multiple instances
    of the same operating system, or different operating systems, can share the
    hardware resources offered by the host.
- Type:
  - Native (bare-metal): Native hypervisors are software systems that run
    directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware, and to monitor the
    guest operating systems.
  - Hosted: Hosted hypervisors are designed to run within a traditional operating system.
    - In other words, a hosted hypervisor adds a distinct software layer on top
      of the host operating system, and the guest operating system becomes a
      third software level above the hardware.
