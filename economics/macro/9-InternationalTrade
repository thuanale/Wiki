- A country will export a good if the world price of the good is higher than
  the domestic price without trade. Trade raises producer surplus, reduces
  consumer surplus, and raises total surplus.
- A country will import a good if the world price is lower than the domestic
  price without trade. Trade lowers producer surplus but raises consumer and
  total surplus.
- A tariff: a tax on imports
  - A tariff benefits producers and generates revenue for the govt, but the
  losses to consumers exceed these gains.
- Import quotas: a quantitative limit on imports of a good.
  - Mostly has the same effects as a tariff:
    - Raises price, reduces quantity of imports.
    - Reduce buyers' welfare.
    - Increase sellers' welfare.
  - A tariff creates revenue for the govt. A quota creates profits for the
    foreign producers of the imported goods, who can sell them at higher price.
  - Or, govt could auction licenses to import to capture this profit as
    revenue. Usually it does not.

- Without tariff:
CS = A + C + B + D + E +F 
PS = G
Total surplus = A + C+ B + D+ E+ F + G
- Tariff:
CS= A + B
PS= C+G
Revenue = E
Total surplus = A + B + C + E +G
 D = DWL from the overproduction
F = DWL from the underconsumption. 
DWL = D + F
