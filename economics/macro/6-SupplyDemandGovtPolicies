1. Government Policies That Alter the Private Market Outcome
- Price controls:
  - Price ceiling: 
    - a legal maximum on the price of a good or service.
    - If the price ceiling is below the eq'm price, it is binding & causes a
      shortage.
  - Price floor:
    - a legal minimum on the price of a good or service.
    - If the price floor is above the eq'm price, it is binding and causes a
      surplus. The labor surplus caused by the minimym wage is unemployment.
- Taxes:
  - The govt can make buyers or sellers pay a specific amount on each unit.

2. Shortages and Rationing:
- With a shortage, sellers must ration the goods among buyers.
- Some rationing mechanisms:
  - Long lines
  - Discrimination according to sellers' biases.
- These mechanisms are often unfair, and inefficient: the goods do not
  necessarily go to the buyers who value them most highly.
- In contrast, when prices are not controlled, the rationing mechanism is
  efficient (to person value goods higher) and impersonal.

3. Evaluating Price control:
- Prices are the signals that guide the allocation of society's resources. This
  allocation is altered when policymakers restrict prices.
- Price controls often intended to help to the poor, but often hurt more than
  help.

4. Taxes:
- The govt levies taxes on many goods & services to raise revenue to pay for
  national defense, public sectors, etc.
- The govt can make buyers or sellers pay the tax.
- The tax can be a % of the good's price, or a specific amount for each unit
  sold.
- A tax on a good places a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price
  sellers receive, and cause the eq'm quantity to fall, whether the tax is
  imposed on buyers or sellers.
- The incidence of a tax is the division of the burden of the tax between
  buyers and sellers, and does not depend on whether the tax is imposed on
  buyers or sellers.
- The incidence of the tax depends on the price elasticities of supply and
  demand.
