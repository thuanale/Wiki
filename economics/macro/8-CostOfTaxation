- A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers and sellers. This welfare loss
  usually exceeds the revenue the tax raises for the govt.
- The fall in total surplus (consumer surplus, producer surplus, and tax
  revenue) is called the deadweight loss (DWL) of the tax.
- A tax has a DWL because it causes consumers to buy less and producers to sell
  less, thus shrinking the market below the level that maximizes total surplus.
- The price elasticities of demand and supply measure how much buyers and
  sellers respond to price changes. Therefore, higher elasticities imply higher
  DWLs.
- An increase in the size of a tax causes the DWL to rise even more.
- An increase in the size of a tax causes revenue to rise at first, but
  eventually revenue falls because the tax reduces the size of the market.
