- A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular product
- A competitive market is one with many buyers and sellers, each has negligible
  effect on price.
- In a perfectly competitive market:
  - all goods exactly the same
  - buyers and sellers so numerous that no one can affect market price - each
    is a price taker.
1. Demand: 
- The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are
  willing and able to purchase.
- Law of demand: the claim that the quatity demanded of a good falls when the
  price of the good rises, other things equal.
- The demand schedule: a table that shows the relationship between the price of
  a good and the quantity demanded.
- Market demand vs individual demand: The quantity demanded in the market is
  the sum of the quantities demanded by all buyers at each price.
- The demand curve shows how price affects quantity demanded, other things
  being equal.
  - These other things are non-price determinants of demand.
  - Changes in them shift D curve.
    - buyers
    - income
      - Increase in income causes increase in quantity demanded at each price,
        shifts D curve to the right.
      - Demand for an inferior good is negatively related to income. An
        increase in income shifts D curves for inferior goods to the left.
    - tastes
      - Anything that causes a shift in tastes toward a good will increase demand for
       that good and shifts its D curve to the right.
    - expectation
    - price of related goods.
      - Two goods are substitutes if an increase in the price of one causes an
        increase in the demand for the other.
      - Two goods are complements if an increase in the price of one causes a
        fall in demand for the other.
2. Supply:
- The quantity supplied of any good is the amount that sellers are willing and
  able to sell.
- Law of supply: the claim that the quantity supplied of a good rises when the
  price of the good rises, other things equal.
- The supply schedule: a table that shows the relationship between the price of
  a good and the quantity supplied.
- The quantity supplied in the market is the sum of the quantities supplied by
  all sellers at each price.
- The supply curve shows how price affect quantity supplied, other things being
  equal.
- These other things are non-price determinants of supply
- Changes in them shift the S curve.
  - Input prices
  - Technology.
  - Number of sellers
  - Expectation.

3. Equilibrium:
- Equilibrium quantityt: The quantity supplied and demanded at equilirium
  price.
- Surplus: excess supply (supplied quantity > demanded quantity)
- Shortage: excess demand (demanded quantity > supplied quantity)
- Three steps to analyzing changes in Eq'm to determine the effects of any
  change:
  - Event shifts S/D/S&D curve.
  - Direction of curve after being shifted.
  - Use supply - demand diagram to see how the shift changes eq'm P and Q
