- Elasticity measures how much one variable responds to changes in another
  variable.
- Definition: Elasticity is a numerical measure of the responsiveness of Qd or
  Qs to one of its determinants.
1. Price Elasticity of Demand:
- Formula:
  Price elasticity of demand = absolute of (percentage change in Qd) /
  (Percentage change in P)
- Measure how much Qd responds to a change in P.
- Or measures the price-sensitivity of buyers' demand.
- Percentage of changes = (end value - start value) / mid value x 100%
- mid value = (higher value - lower value) / 2
- The price elasticity of demand depends on:
  - The extent to which close substitutes are available.
  - Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury.
  - How broadly or narrowly the good is defined.
  - The time horizon - elasticity is higher in the long run than the short run.
- The variety of Demand Curves:
  - The price elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the
    demand curve.
  - Rule of thumb: 
    - the flatter the curve, the bigger the elasticity.
    - the steeper the curve, the smaller the elasticity.
  - Five different classifications of D curves:
    - extreme: price unchage (extreme price sensitivity) or quantity unchange (price sensitivity = 0)
    - inelasticity: price elasticity < 1 (low price sensitivity)
    - unit elasticity: price elasticity = 1 (intermediate)
    - elasticity: price elasticity > 1 (high)
- Revenue = P x Q 
  - If demand is elasic: the fall in revenue from lower Q is greater than the
    increase in revenue from higher P.
  - If demand is inelastic: the fall in revenue from lower Q is smaller than
    the increase in revenue from higher P.

2. Price Elasticity of Supply:
- Formula: 
  Price Elasticity of Supply = absolute of (percentage change in Qs) /
  (percentage of change in P).
- Measure sellers' price-sensitivity.
- Use the midpoint method to compute the percentage changes.

3. Relationship between demand and supply:
- When supply is inelastic, an increase in demand has a bigger impact on price
  than on quantity.
- When supply is elastic, an increase in demand has a lower impact on price
  than on quantity.
- Supply often become less elastic as Q rises, due to capacity limits.

4. Other elasticities:
- Income elasticity of demand = absolute of (percentage change is Qd) /
  (percentage change in income).
- Cross-price elasticity of demand:
  - measures the response of demand for one good to changes in the price of
    another good.
  - cross-price elasticity of demand = (% change in Qd for good 1) / (% change
    in price of good 2)
  - For subsititutes, cross-price elasticity > 0
  - For complements, cross-price elasticity < 0
