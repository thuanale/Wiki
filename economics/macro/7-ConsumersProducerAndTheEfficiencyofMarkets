1. Willingness to Pay & Consumer surplus
- The height of the D curve reflects the value of the good to buyers - their
  willingness to pay for it.
- Consumer surplus is the difference between what buyers are willing to pay for
  a good and what they actually pay.
- On the graph, consumer surplus is the area between P and the D curve.
- Ex:
 P

CS = 1/2x(7-4)(10-0)
Fall in CS due to buyer leaving market = 1/2 * (4-3)(20-10)
Fall in CS due to remaing buyers paying higher P = (4-3)x(10-0)

2. Willingness to Sell & Producer surplus.
- The height of the S curve is sellers' cost of producing the good. Sellers are
  willing to sell if the price they get is at least as high as their cost.
- Producer surplus is the difference between what sellers receive for a good
  and their cost of producing it.
- On the graph, producer surplus is the area between P and the S curve.
- Ex:
 P         S

PS = 1/2*(6-2)*(10-0)
Fall in PS due to sellers leaving market = 1/2*(7-6)(20-10)
Fall in PS due to remaining sellers getting lower P = (7-6)*(20-10)

3. 
- To measure society's well-being, we use total surplus, the sum of consumer
  and producer surplus.
- Efficiency means that total surplus is maximized, that the goods are produced
  by sellers with lowest cost, and that they are consumed by buyers who most
  value them.
- Under perfect competion, the market outcome is efficient. Altering it would
  reduce total surplus.
- The market eq'm (equalibrium) quantity maximizes total surplus: At any other quantity, can
  increase total surplus by moving toward the market eq'm quantity.
- Govt cannot raise total surplus by changing the market's allocation of
  resources.
- Market failures occur when:
  - A buyer or seller has market power (monopoly)
  - transactions have side effects, called externalities, that affect
    bystanders.
