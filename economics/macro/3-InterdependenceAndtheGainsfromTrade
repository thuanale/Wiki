  another producer.
- If each country has an absolute advantage in one good & specializes in that
  good, then both countries can gain from trade.
- 2 countries can gain from trade when each specializes in the good it produces
  at lowest cost.
- comparative advantage: the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity
  cost than another producer.
