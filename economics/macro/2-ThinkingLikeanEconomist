- Economist play two roles:
  - scientists: try to explain the world.
  - policy advisors: try to improve it.
- Assumptions: simplify the complex world, make it easier to understand.
- Model: a highly simplified representation of a more complicated reality.
- Model 1: The circular-flow diagram: a visual model of the economy, shows how dollars
  flow through markets among households and firms.
  - 2 type of actors:
    - households
    - firms
  - 2 markets:
    - the market for goods & services
    - the market for factors of production.
  - Factors of production: the resouces the ecnomy uses to produce goods &
    services.
- Model 2: Production Posibilities Frontier (PPF): a graph that shows the combinations
  of two goods the economy can possibly produce given the available resources
  and the available technology.
  - Moving along a PPF involves shifting resources from the production of one
    good to the other.
  - Society faces a tradeoff
  - The slope of the PPF tells you the opportunity cost of one good in terms of
    the other.
  - economic growth shifts the PPF outward.
  - The slope of a line equals the rise over the run, the amount the line rises
    when you move to the right by one unit.
  - the shape of slope: straight or bow-shaped
    - bow shaped: 
      - when different workers have different skills, different
      opportunity costs of producing one good in terms of the other.
      - when there is some other resource, or mix of resources with varying
        opportunity costs.
  - Scientist: make positive statements: attempt to describe the world as it is.
  - Advisor: make normative statements: attempt to prescribe how the world should be.
  - Microeconomics: is the study of how households and firms make decisions and
    how they interact in markets.
  - Macroeconomics: is the study of economy-wide phenomena, including flation,
    unemployment & economic growth.
