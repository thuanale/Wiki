1. Cloud Models:
- Security requirements, strategies and responsibilities.

2. Three documented models:
- The Cloud Risk Accumulation Model of CSA.
- Jericho Forum's Cloud Cube Model.
- NIST Model (including multi-tenancy).

3. The Cloud Risk Accumulation Model of CSA:
- Understanding the layer dependency of cloud service models is critical when
  analysing and defining the security risks (and subsequent security
  safeguards) of cloud computing.
- Defines a notional interdependency between the three major service models.
- Indicates that the security burden is directly proportional to the deployed
  models.

4. Cloud Cube Model:
- 4 dimensions of deployment:
  - Internal (I) / External (E)
  - Proprietary (P) / Open (O)
  - Perimeterized / De-perimeterized Architectures.
  - Insourced / Outsourced

5. NIST:
- Defines cloud options in terms of: deployment models, services models and
  essential chracteristics.
- Multi-tenancy and security:
  - Implies the sharing resources & apps w/ multiple users from different
    companies.
  - Implies the requirement for a rigid security policy guaranteeing consumer
    data segregation, isolation, service levels, and governance.
