1. Data Integrity:
- Maintain data integrity while in a passive state or in transit
- Ensure that backup is an exact copy of the source - no corruption
- Ensure that data is recoverable
- Ensure that access is controlled.
- Ensure that deleted data is in fact deleted.
- Ensure that data cannot be corrupted or stolen.
- Audit access to data.
- Provide isolation.

2. Access, Authentication:
- Deploy/ensure inter-device trust
- Deploy/ensure/secure user identification
- Strong passwords & password change
- Manage Public/Private keys
- Maintain security certificates
- Maintain access audit logging.

3. Contingency, Data Availability:
- Deploy a failover machanism
- Ensure efficient recovery of data
- Ensure efficient access - multi-location topology
- Ensure an adequate backup schedule
- Permit security assessment from a neutral third-party
- Ensure smooth transition - no lock-in
- Prevent denial of service.

4. Apps, Functions & services:
- Examine security vulnerabilities and take steps to ensure protection.
- Emphasis on PaaS where the developer is responsible for the security of any
  apps that will be hosted on a SaaS platform.
- Emphasis on SaaS platform and its inherent security requirements, the
  responsibility of which fall almost exclusively on the SaaS provider.
