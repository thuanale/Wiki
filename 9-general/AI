- Artificial Intelligence: an umbrella term, which we can loosely describe as:
  "all the various techniques we might use to make a computer do something
  smart".
- Applied Intelligence:
- AI winter: a long time with minimal interest and reduced funding/investment
  in AI.
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI - Strong AI or Full AI): AI at a level
  capable of understanding, learning and/or performing any mental/intellectual
  task that a human can do.
- Narrow AI (Weak AI): AI that operates on one specific task - though can often
  outperform a human at that task.
- Machine Learning: A successful subset of AI that focuses on learning from
  data, not on programming explicit rules to follow.
- Deep Learning: A subset of ML that uses neural networks.
- NLP: Natural Language Processing
  - NLU: Natural Language Understanding
  - NLG: Natural Language Generation.
- Algorithmic Bias: Results that create or reinforce unfair outcomes from
  repeatable technical issues - often unitentional, and also often difficult to
  recognize.
- The Black Box of AI: Manu ML/ Deep Learning models return results and
  predictions, but do not provide any explanation of those results.
- Deepfakes: using Deep Learning techniques to manipulate audio, images and
  video - creating extremely realistic and deceptive content.
