1. Type of data:
- VM machine data
- Unstructured data: format of unstructured data is referred to as
  non-relational.
- Structured data.

2. Tier:
- Standard: used HDD, usually used for infrequently accessed or bulk data
- Premium: used SSD, usually best for VM's disk with I/O intensive
  applications.
- Cannot convert between Standard and Premium.

3. Data services:
- Azure Blob Storage (containers): A massively scalable object store for
  unstructed or non-relational data (text, and binary data).
- Azure Files: : Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- Azure Queue Storage: A messaging store for reliable messaging between
  application components.
- Azure Table Storage:  A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data
  or relational data.

4. Storage Account Types:
- Standard general purpose v2:
  - Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage), Queue Storage, Table Storage,
    and Azure Files.
  - Uses 3 resouces to store & manage data:
    - An Azure storage account.
    - Containers in an Azure storage account.
    - Blobs in a container.
  - Need to configure these settings:
    - Blob container options
    - Blob types and upload options
    - Blob Storage access tiers
    - Blob lifecycle rules
    - Blob object replication options
- Premium block blobs:
  - Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage).
  - Premium storage account for block blobs and append blobs.
  - Recommended for applications with high transaction rates.
- Premium file shares:
  - Azure Files.
  - Recommeded for enterprise or high-performance scale apps.
- Premium page blobs:
  - Pages blobs only.
  - Page blobs are ideal for storing index-based and sparse data structures,
    such as operating systems, data disks for virtual machines, and databases.

5. Blob types:
- Block blobs:
  - Default
  - A block blob consists of blocks of data that are assembled to make a
    blob.
- Append blobs:
  - An append blob is similar to a block blob because the append blob also
    consists of blocks of data.
  - The blocks of data in an append blob are optimized for append
    operations.
  - Append blobs are useful for logging scenarios, where the amount of data
    can increase as the logging operation continues.
- Page blobs:
  - A page blob can be up to 8 TB in size. 
  - Page blobs are more efficient for frequent read/write operations.
  - Azure Virtual Machines uses page blobs for operating system disks and
    data disks.
- After you create a blob, you can't change its type.

6. Determine replication strategies:
- Locally redundant storage (LRS):
  - Locally redundant storage is the lowest-cost replication option and offers
    the least durability compared to other strategies.
  - If a data center-level disaster occurs, such as fire or flooding, all
    replicas might be lost or unrecoverable.
- Zone redundant storage (ZRS):
  - Zone redundant storage synchronously replicates your data across three
    storage clusters in a single region.
  - Each availability zone, and the ZRS cluster within it, is autonomous, and
    has separate utilities and networking capabilities.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS):
  - Geo-redundant storage replicates your data to a secondary region.
  - Default replication option.
  - Copies the data synchronously three times within a single physical location
    in the primary region by using LRS.
  - GRS provides a higher level of durability even during a regional outage.
  - Options:
    - GRS:
      - replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region.
      - The data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover
        from the primary to secondary region.
    - Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): replicates your data to
      another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the
      option to read from the secondary region.
- Process:
  - All data is first replicated with locally redundant storage. 
  - An update is first committed to the primary location and replicated by
    using LRS.
  - The update is then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region by
    using GRS.
  - When data is written to the secondary location, it's also replicated within
    that location by using LRS.
  - Both the primary and secondary regions manage replicas across separate
    fault domains and upgrade domains within a storage scale unit.
  - The storage scale unit is the basic replication unit within the
    datacenter.
  - Replication at this level is provided by LRS.

- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS):
  - Geo-zone-redundant storage combines the high availability of zone-redundant
    storage with protection from regional outages as provided by geo-redundant
    storage.
  - Options:
    - GZRS:
      - The data is available to be read-only if Microsoft inititates a
        failover from the primary to secondary region.
    - RA-GZRS: read-access to data in the 2nd region.

7. Access storage:
- Every object you store in Azure Storage has a unique URL address.
- Your storage account name forms the subdomain portion of the URL address.
- The combination of the subdomain and the domain name, which is specific to
  each service, forms an endpoint for your storage account.
- Configure custom domains:
  - direct mapping: Direct mapping lets you enable a custom domain for a
    subdomain to an Azure storage account.
    - For this approach, you create a CNAME record that points from the
      subdomain to the Azure storage account.
  - Intermediary domain mapping is applied to a domain that's already in use
    within Azure.
    - This approach might result in minor downtime while the domain is being
      mapped.
    - To avoid downtime, you can use the asverify intermediary domain to
      validate the domain.
    - By prepending the asverify keyword to your own subdomain, you permit
      Azure to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record
      for the domain.
- By prepending the asverify keyword to your own subdomain, you permit Azure
  to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record for the
  domain.
- After you modify the DNS record for the domain, your domain is mapped to the
  blob endpoint with no downtime.

7. Configure Blob Storage:
- Azure Blob Storage uses a container resource to group a set of blobs.
- A blob must be stored in a container resource.
- Thing to notice:
  - All blobs must be in a container.
  - A container can store an unlimited number of blobs.
  - An Azure storage account can contain an unlimited number of containers.
  - You can create the container in the Azure portal.
  - You upload blobs into a container.
- Configure a container:
  - Name: unique within the Azure storage account.
  - Public access level:
    - Private
    - Blob: allow anonymous public read access for the blobs only.
    - Container: Allow anonymous public read and list access to the entire
      container, including the blobs.
- Assign blob access tiers:
  - Hot:
    - default option
    - The Hot tier is optimized for frequent reads and writes of objects in the
      Azure storage account
    - A good usage case is data that is actively being processed.
  - Cool:
    - The Cool tier is optimized for storing large amounts of data that's
      infrequently accessed.
    - This tier is intended for data that remains in the Cool tier for at least
      30 days.
    - A usage case for the Cool tier is short-term backup and disaster recovery
      datasets and older media content.
    - Not frequently accessed, but need to be immediately available.
  - Archive:
    - The Archive tier is an offline tier that's optimized for data that can
      tolerate several hours of retrieval latency.
    - Data must remain in the Archive tier for at least 180 days or be subject
      to an early deletion charge.
    - Data for the Archive tier includes secondary backups, original raw data,
      and legally required compliance information.
    - Has highest access data.
    - Lowest storage costs.
  - Premium:
    - best suited for I/O instensive workloads that require low & consistent
      storage latency.

- Configure life-cycle.
- Object replication:
  - Object replication copies blobs in a container asynchronously according to
    policy rules that you configure.
  - During the replication process, the following contents are copied from the
    source container to the destination container:
    - The blob contents
    - The blob metadata and properties
    - Any versions of data associated with the blob
  - Require:
    - Blob versioning is enabled on both containers.
    - Blob snapshots are not replicated.
    - Tiers of containers are in the Hot or Cool & can be in different.
    - Congiure replication policy.

9. Upload to Blob storage:
- Tool:
  - AzCopy: cli.
  - Azure Storage Data Movement library: .NET library for moving data between
    Azure Storage services.
  - Azure Data Factory: You can copy data to and from Blob Storage by using the
    account key, shared access signature, service principal, or managed
    identities for Azure resources authentications.
  - blobfuse: A virtual file system driver for Azure Blob Storage. You can use
    blobfuse to access your existing block blob data in your storage account
    through the Linux file system.
  - Azure Data Box Disk:
    - A service for transferring on-premises data to Blob Storage when large
      datasets or network constraints make uploading data over the wire
      unrealistic.
    - You can use Azure Data Box Disk to request solid-state disks (SSDs) from Microsoft.
    - You can copy your data to those disks and ship them back to Microsoft to
      be uploaded into Blob Storage.
  - Azure Import/Export: A service that helps you export large amounts of data
    from your storage account to hard drives that you provide and that
    Microsoft then ships back to you with your data.

10. Cost:
- Performance tiers
- Data access costs
- Transaction costs
- Geo-replication data transfer costs
- Outbound data transfer costs
- Changes to the storage tier.
