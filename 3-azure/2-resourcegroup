1. Terminology:
- resource:
  - A manageable item that is available through Azure.
- resource group: 
  - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. 
  - The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only
    those resources that you want to manage as a group.
  - You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on
    what makes the most sense for your organization.
- resource provider:
  - A service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage through
    Resource Manager.
  - Each resource provider offers operations for  working with the resources
    that are deployed.
  - The name of a resource type is in the format:
    {resource-provider}/{resource-type}.
- template:
  - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or more resources
    to deploy to a resource group.
  - It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources. The
    template can be used to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly.
- declarative syntax:
  - Syntax that lets you state "Here is what I intend to create" without having
    to write the sequence of programming commands to create it.

2. Benefit of Resource group:
- deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group.
- deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle & in a consistent
  state.
- manage your infrastructure through declarative templates.
- define the dependencies between resources.
- apply access control to all services in your resource group because
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management
  platform.
- apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your
  subscription.
- clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources
  sharing the same tag.

3. Best practice:
- Define and deploy your infrastructure through the declarative syntax in Azure
  Resource Manager templates.
- Define all deployment and configuration steps in the template.
- Run imperative commands to manage your resources.
- Arrange resources with the same lifecycle in a resource group.
- Use tags for all other organizing of resources

4. Create resource groups:
- Resources can be deployed to any new or existing resource group.
- Deployment of resources to a resource group becomes a job where you can track
  the template execution.
- Deployments are incremental.

5. Considerations:
- Resources can only exist in one resource group.
- Resource Groups cannot be renamed.
- Resource Groups can have resources of many different types (services).
- Resource Groups can have resources from many different regions.

6. Creating resource groups:
- All the resources in your group should share the same lifecycle. 
- Each resource can only exist in one resource group.
- you can add or remove a resource to a resource group at any time.
- can move a resource from one resource group to another group.
- A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions.
- A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions.
- A resource can interact with resources in other resource groups.

7. Resource locks:
- Resource Manager locks allow organizations to put a structure in place that
  prevents the accidental deletion of resources in Azure.
  - You can associate the lock with a subscription, resource group, or resource.
  - Locks are inherited by child resources.
- Lock types:
  - Read-Only locks, which prevent any changes to the resource.
  - Delete locks, which prevent deletion.
- Only the Owner and User Access Administrator roles can create or delete
  management locks.

8. Move resource:
- When moving resources, both the source group and the target group are locked
  during the operation.
- Write and delete operations are blocked on the resource groups until the move completes. 
- This lock means you can't add, update, or delete resources in the resource groups.
- Locks don't mean the resources aren't available.

9. Determine resource limit: 
- When you need to increase a default limit, there is a Request Increase link.
- All resources have a maximum limit listed in Azure limits.
- If you are at the maximum limit, the limit can't be increased.
