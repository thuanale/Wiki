1. User account:
- Every user who wants access to Azure resources needs an Azure user account.
- Supported account:
  - Cloud identity:
    - A user account with a cloud identity is defined only in Azure AD.
    - Can be for user accounts defined in your Azure AD organization, and also
      for user accounts defined in an external Azure AD instance.
    - When a cloud identity is removed from the primary directory, the user
      account is deleted.
  - Directory-synchronized identity:
    - defined in an on-premises Active Directory.
    - A synchronization activity occurs via Azure AD Connect to bring these
      user accounts in to Azure.
    - The source for these accounts is Windows Server Active Directory.
  - Guest user:
    - Guest user accounts are defined outside Azure.
    - The source for guest user accounts is Invited user.
- Configuration:
  - Consider where users are defined.
  - Consider support for external contributors
  - Consider a combination of user accounts

2. Manage:
- New user:
  - Cloud identity: Create via Azure AD or invited as guest user for external.
  - A new user account must have a display name and an associated user account
    name.
  - Information and settings that describe a user are stored in the user
    account profile.
  - A user with Global administrator or User administrator privileges can
    preset profile data in user accounts.
  - Non-admin users can set some of their own profile data, but they can't
    change their display name or account name.
- Restore:
  - Restore operations for a deleted account are available up to 30 days after
    an account is removed.
  - After 30 days, a deleted user account can't be restored.
- Consider gathered account data. Collect sign-in and audit log information for
  user accounts.
- Consider user profile data. Allow users to set their profile information for
  their accounts, as needed.

3. Create bulk user accounts:
- Only Global administrators or User administrators have privileges to create
  and delete user accounts in the Azure portal.
- To complete bulk create or delete operations, the admin fills out a
  comma-separated values (CSV) template of the data for the user accounts.
- Bulk operation templates can be downloaded from the Azure AD portal.
- Bulk lists of user accounts can be downloaded.

4. Group accounts:
- Type:
  - Security groups:
    - Used to manage member and computer access to shared resources for a group
      of users.
    - Implemented by Azure AD administrators.
    - Can apply the same permissions to all members of a group.
  - MS 365 groups:
    - enable group access for guest users outside your Azure AD organization.
    - Normal users and Azure AD admins can both use Microsoft 365 groups.
- Group members have access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint
  site, and more.
- Access rights for group members:
  - Assigned: add specific user
  - Dynamic user: automatically add/remove user which is met specific rule.
  - Dynamic device: (Security groups only) Apply dynamic group rules to
    automatically add and remove devices in security groups.

5. Create administrative units:
- Consider:
 - management tools
 - role requirements in the Azure portal.
 - Scope
