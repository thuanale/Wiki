1. Region:
- A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but
  potentially multiple datacenters.
- The datacenters are in close proximity and networked together with a
  low-latency network.
- Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography
  to make a regional pair (or paired regions).
- Characteristics of region pair:
  - Physical isolation:  prefer at least 300 miles of separation between
    datacenters in a regional pair (in most cases).
  - Platform-provided replication.
  - Region recovery order: bring one region up first.
  - Sequential updates.
  - Data residency: Regions reside within the same geography as their enabled
    set (except for the Brazil South and Singapore regions).

2. Subscription: 
- An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that's linked to an
  Azure account.
- Characteristics:
  - Every Azure cloud service belongs to a subscription.
  - Each subscription can have a different billing and payment configuration.
  - Multiple subscriptions can be linked to the same Azure account.
  - More than one Azure account can be linked to the same subscription.
  - Billing for Azure services is done on a per-subscription basis.
  - If your Azure account is the only account associated with a subscription,
    you're responsible for the billing requirements.
  - Programmatic operations for a cloud service might require a subscription
    ID.

3. Obtain subscription:
- Way to obtain subscription:
  - an Enterprise agreement: Any Enterprise Agreement customer can add Azure to
    their agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. The
    commitment is consumed throughout the year by using any combination of the
    wide variety of cloud services Azure offers.
  - request a Microsoft reseller: Buy Azure through the Open Licensing program,
    which provides a simple, flexible way to purchase cloud services from your
    Microsoft reseller.
  - Microsoft partner.
  - open personal free account for a trial subscription.

5. Tag:
- Each resource tag has a name and a value.
- The tag name remains constant for all resources that have the tag applied.
- The tag value can be selected from a defined set of values, or unique for a
  specific resource instance.
- A resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs.
- Tags applied to a resource group aren't inherited by the resources in the
resource group.
6. Cost savings:
- Reservations: 
  - Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state
    of your resources.
  - save up to 72% on pay-as-you-go prices.
- Azure Hybrid Benefits:
  - Access pricing benefits if you have a license that includes Software
    Assurance.
  - Azure Hybrid Benefits helps maximize the value of existing on-premises
    Windows Server or SQL Server license investments when migrating to Azure.
- Azure Credits: Use the monthly credit benefit to develop, test, and
  experiment with new solutions on Azure.
- Azure regions: Cost is different among regions
- Budgets:
