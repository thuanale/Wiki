1. Managmenet groups:
- Management groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions. 
  - organize subscriptions into management groups
  - the governance conditions you apply cascade by inheritance to all
    associated subscriptions.
- However, all subscriptions within a single management group must trust the
  same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
- Moving multiple subscriptions under that management group:
   - create one Azure role assignment on the management group, which will
     inherit that access to all the subscriptions.
   - One assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to
     everything they need instead of scripting Azure RBAC over different
     subscriptions.
- Important facts:
  - 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
  - A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth.
  - This limit doesn't include the Root level or the subscription level.
  - Each management group and subscription can only support one parent.
  - Each management group can have many children.
  - All subscriptions and management groups are within a single hierarchy in
    each directory.

1.1  Root management group:
- Each directory is given a single top-level management group called the root
  management group.
- Built into the hierarchy to have all management groups and subscriptions fold
  up to it.
- Allows for global policies and Azure role assignments to be applied at the
  directory level.
- The Azure AD Global Administrator needs to elevate themselves to the User
  Access Administrator role of this root group initially.
- After elevating access, the administrator can assign any Azure role to other
  directory users or groups to manage the hierarchy.
- As administrator, you can assign your own account as owner of the root
  management group.
- Facts:
  - By default, the root management group's display name is Tenant root group
    and operates itself as a management group.
  - The ID is the same value as the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant
    ID.
  - To change the display name, your account must be assigned the Owner or
    Contributor role on the root management group.
  - The root management group can't be moved or deleted, unlike other
    management groups.
  - All subscriptions and management groups fold up to the one root management
    group within the directory.
    - All resources in the directory fold up to the root management group for
      global management.
    - New subscriptions are automatically defaulted to the root management
      group when created.
  - All Azure customers can see the root management group, but not all
    customers have access to manage that root management group.
    - Everyone who has access to a subscription can see the context of where
      that subscription is in the hierarchy.
    - No one is given default access to the root management group.
    - Azure AD Global Administrators are the only users that can elevate
      themselves to gain access.
    - Once they have access to the root management group, the global
      administrators can assign any Azure role to other users to manage it.

1.2. Custom role:
- Azure custom role support for management groups is currently in preview with
  some limitations.
- You can define the management group scope in the Role Definition's assignable
  scope.
- That Azure custom role will then be available for assignment on that
  management group and any management group, subscription, resource group, or
  resource under it.

2. Policy:
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you can use to create, assign, and
  manage policies.
- You can use policies to enforce rules on your resources to meet corporate
  compliance standards and service level agreements.
- Azure Policy runs evaluations and scans on your resources to make sure
  they're compliant.
- Advantage	Description:
  - Enforce rules and compliance:
    - Enable built-in policies, or build custom policies for all resource types.
    - Support real-time policy evaluation and enforcement, and periodic or
      on-demand compliance evaluation.
  - Apply policies at scale
    - Apply policies to a management group with control across your entire
      organization.
    - Apply multiple policies and aggregate policy states with policy
      initiative. Define an exclusion scope.
  - Perform remediation
    - Conduct real-time remediation, and remediation on your existing resources.
  - Exercise governance
    - Implement governance tasks for your environment:
      - Support multiple engineering teams (deploying to and operating in the
        environment).
      - Manage multiple subscriptions
      - Standardize and enforce how cloud resources are configured
      - Manage regulatory compliance, cost control, security, and design
        consistency.
- Policy definition:
  - Describes the compliance conditions for a resource, and the actions to
    complete when the conditions are met.
  - One or more policy definitions are grouped into an initiative definition,
    to control the scope of your policies and evaluate the compliance of your
    resources.
  - Step:
    - Create policy definiton.
    - Create an initiative definition.
    - Define scope
    - Determine compliance.

3. RBAC:
- Management group support Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) for all
  resource accesses and role definitions.
- RBAC is not enabled by default.
- These permissions are inherited to child resources that exist in the hierarchy.
- Concepts:
  - Security principal (Who)
    - An object that represents something that requests access to resources.
  - Role definition (What)
    - A set of permissions that lists the allowed operations. 
    - Type: builtin & custom role definitions.
  - Scope (Where)
    - The boundary for the requested level of access, or "how much" access is
      granted.
  - Assignment:
    - Attaches a role definition to a security principal at a particular
      scope.
    - Users can grant the access described in a role definition by creating
      (attaching) an assignment for the role.
- Different with Azure AD policy:
	               |  Azure RBAC roles	                |         Azure AD admin roles

- Fundametal roles:
  - Owner:
    - The Owner role has full access to all resources, including the right to
      delegate access to others.
    - The Service Administrator and Co-Administrators roles are assigned the
      Owner role at the subscription scope.
  - Contributor:
    - The Contributor role can create and manage all types of Azure resources.
    - This role can't grant access to others.
  - Reader:
    - The Reader role can view existing Azure resources.
  - User Access Administrator:
    - The User Access Administrator role can manage user access to Azure
      resources.
- The access granted by a role, the effective permissions, is computed by
  subtracting the NotActions operations from the Actions operations.
- Azure RBAC is an allow model. This means that when you're assigned a role,
  Azure RBAC allows you to perform certain actions, such as read, write, or
  delete.
