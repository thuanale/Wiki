1. Definition:
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based
  directory and identity management service. 
- Azure AD helps to support user access to resources and applications.
- Primarily an identity solution.

2. Features:
- Single sign-on access (SSO)
- Ubiquitos device support
- Secure remote access: can include multifactor authentication (MFA),
  conditional access policies, and group-based access management.
- Cloud extensibility
- Sensitive data protection.
- Self-service support.

3. Key concepts:
- Identity:
  - An identity is an object that can be authenticated. 
  - Can be a user with a username and password, applications or other servers
    that require authentication by using secret keys or certificates.
- Account:
  - An account is an identity that has data associated with it.
  - To have an account, you must first have a valid identity.
- Azure AD account:
  - An Azure AD account is an identity that's created through Microsoft cloud
    service, such as Azure AD, Microsoft 365.
  - Identities are stored in Azure AD and are accessible to your organization's
    cloud service subscriptions.
  - The Azure AD account is also called a work or school account.
- Azure tenant (directory):
  - An Azure tenant is a single dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD.
  - Each tenant (also called a directory) represents a single organization. 
  - When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription,
    a new tenant is automatically created.
  - Because each tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD, you
    can create multiple tenants or instances.
- Azure subscription:
  - An Azure subscription is used to pay for Azure cloud services.
  - A subscription is linked to a credit card.
  - Each subscription is joined to a single tenant. You can have multiple
    subscriptions.

4. Comparision between Active Directory Domain Service and Azure AD:
- AD DS is only one component of the Windows Active Directory suite of
  technologies.
- The suite also includes:
  - Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
  - Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LS)
  - Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
  - Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS).
- Advantage over AD DS:
  - Manage users, groups, policies
  - Flat structure without GPO.
  - Only support HTTP & HTTPS:
    - Rest API over HTTP, HTTPS (not LDAP)
    - Authentication over HTTP, HTTPS protocol (not Kerberos):
      - SAML
      - WS-Federation.
      - OpenID Connect for authentication (and OAuth for authoriazation).
    - Application: on Internet based.
  - Identity solution:
    - Azure AD is a full identity solution.
    - Azure AD is designed for internet-based applications that use HTTP and
      HTTPS communications.
-  You can extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud by using Azure
   AD Connect.

5. Implement Azure AD join:
- Azure Active Directory enables single sign-on (SSO) to devices, applications,
  and services from anywhere.
- Benefit:
  - SSO.
  - Enterprise state roaming: sync user settings & app settings data to joined
    devices.
  - Access to MS Store for Business
  - Windows Hello
  - Restriction of access
  - Seamless access to on-premises resources.
- Configuration points:
 - Register:
   - provides the device with an identity that's used to authenticate the
     device when a user signs into Azure AD.
 - Join: extension of register.
   - provides the benefits of registering, and also changes the local state of
     the device:
   - Changing the local state enables your users to sign into a device by using
    an organizational work or school account instead of a personal account.
 - Combine with other solution.

6. Self-service password reset (SSPR)
- Consider:
  - Global Administrator privileges:
    - SSPR requires an Azure AD account with Global Administrator privileges to
      manage SSPR options.
    - This account can always reset their own passwords, no matter what options
      are configured.
  - Security group: SSPR uses a security group to limit the users who have SSPR
    privileges.
  - License: All user accounts in your organization must have a valid license
    to use SSPR.
- Configuration:
  - Targeted users: Disabled(default)/Selected/Enabled (Allow all)
  - Authentication methods: one (default) or multiple.
  - Combine methods for stronger security.
 
7 . Access:
- Type of AD user:
  - Administrator
  - Member
  - Guest
-  Role:
  - Azure AD roles
  - RBAC for Azure resource.
- Assign access rights:
  - Direct assignment.
  - Group assignment.
  - Rule-based assignment.
- Allow external users:
  - Azure AD B2B vs AD Federation:
    - With Azure Active Directory B2B, you don't have to manage your external
      users' identities.
    - The partner has the responsibility to manage its own identities.
    - External users continue to use their current identities to collaborate
      with your organization.
  - A federation is where you have a trust established with another
    organization, or a collection of domains, for shared access to a set of
    resources.
    - You might be using an on-premises identity provider and authorization
      service like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) that has an
      established trust with Azure AD.
    - To get access to resources, all users have to provide their credentials
      and successfully authenticate against the AD FS server.
    - If you have someone trying to authenticate outside the internal network,
      you need to set up a web application proxy.
